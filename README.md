# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a a website that filters the data by all the column headers, allowing the user to customize their view of the data table.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript functions were used to add the filtering functionality to the table and HTML was used to display the JavaScript code. 

## Recommendation
Since there are not too many lines of data, I recommend adding drop down options for each filter rather than requiring the user to manually input info in the fields for their search. This is beneficial especially if the user does not have prior knowledge of the options available for filtering in the data table.
